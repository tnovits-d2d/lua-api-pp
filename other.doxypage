/**
* @page stack_management Automatic stack management
* The library aims to free you of tedious stack management completely. You can freely
* use indexing, function calls, arithmetics, concatenation and so on, with nesting
* operation results and never worry about placing temporary values on the stack in correct order or
* removing those you no longer need. It is done by Lua API++ objects.
*
* These objects allow smooth operations when used correctly. There are some limitations on how these objects can be used
* without breaking the stack integrity. These objects are responsible for allocating and freeing space on Lua stack.
* In order to do so, these objects must have strictly controlled lifetime (only be declared as local variables),
* must not be copied, moved (with some safe exceptions like creating a @ref lua::Value "value anchor" by assignment),
* stored in containers or be inherited from.
* Many unsafe operations are already disabled for those objects, but there are still some ways left to break their proper functioning.
*
* In short, it is useful to remember this:
* @li @ref lua::State "State" cannot be copied or moved.
* @li @ref lua::Context "Context" is given to function, it cannot be copied, moved, stored or created
* (exception: Context can be created explicitly if necessary).
* @li @ref lua::Retval "Retvals" can only be created by calling @ref lua::Context::ret "ret" in <b><code>return</code></b> statement.
* They cannot be copied or moved, but can be returned from functions.
* @li Non-owning @ref lua::Valref "value references" may be freely copied and passed around, but their
* lifetime must never extend the lifetime of @ref basic_values_anchors "anchor objects" they refer to.
* @li @ref basic_values_anchors "Value anchors" are designed to be used as local variables only,
* to preserve correct push/pop order. They may be @ref stack_management_function "passed to and returned from" functions,
* but only in one direction.
* @li @ref basic_values "Temporaries" that are created as result of operation are designed to be used as temporaries only.
* If you want to capture their value, @ref basic_values_anchors "anchor" it, because <b><code>auto</code></b> won't work.
*
* @note The possibility to return Retvals and anchor objects from functions is built around compiler feature
* named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_value_optimization">RVO</a>. You may get link errors if your compiler doesn't support it,
* or it was disabled, or failed to work properly.
*
* @section stack_management_function Passing values to and returning from functions
* It is possible to pass into functions and return @ref basic_values_anchors "anchor objects" and @ref lua::Valref "value references",
* but not as freely as normal values:
* @subsection stack_management_function_valref References
* Returned @ref lua::Valref "value references" must reference only anchor objects existing outside of called function.
* @subsection stack_management_function_anchor Anchors
* Function may have @ref basic_values_anchors "anchor object" as return type or in parameters, but not both.
* You may easily memorize this rule as "one-way rule" or "in or out rule". While both of these actions make sense
* and are useful, doing them simultaneously will break the stack and cause incorrect behavior, so it's usability over safety choice.
* A good reason to have @ref basic_values_anchors "anchors" as parameters or return type is their ability to capture
* the contents of @ref basic_values "temporaries" (so a temporary-producing expression may be passed into function or returned from it).
*
* @page usage Using the library
* @section usage_basic Using the library with your project
* This library is intended to be compiled with your project. All the files you're going to need for the project are in luapp/ directory.
* Add a source file containing single line @code{.cpp}#include <luapp/impl.cpp> @endcode to your project.
* In @ref configuring_performance "header-only" mode this step is not required.
* Just include @ref luapp.hpp "luapp/luapp.hpp" in your sources and you're ready to go.
*
* Do not include any *.hxx files: those depend on particular inclusion order in which they are included into @ref luapp.hpp.
* Besides Lua API itself (configured with @ref luainc.h) and standard C++ library there are no external dependencies.
*
* Set the appropriate @ref configuring "configuration macros" if needed.
*
* @section usage_tests Building the tests (for library development)
* Unit tests for this library are built on Boost::Test framework, so the additional requirement is (obviously) <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a>.
*
* @section Documentation
* The documentation is created with <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/">Doxygen</a> from the library sources.
* Doxygen configuration file and additional pages are provided with the library.
*
*
* @page configuring Configuring the library
* Additional library features can be configured with special macros. These macros must be defined project-wide to maintain consistency.
* @section configuring_compatibility Compatibility
* @subsection configuring_compatibility_langver Lua language version
* @li <code><b>LUAPP_COMPATIBILITY_V51</b></code>;
* @li <code><b>LUAPP_COMPATIBILITY_V52</b></code>;
* @li <code><b>LUAPP_COMPATIBILITY_V53</b></code>.
* @subsection configuring_compatibility_nrvo NRVO support
* The macro <code><b>LUAPP_COMPATIBILITY_NO_NRVO</b></code> disables tests that require @ref compatibility_nrvo "NRVO" compiler capability.
* Also it disables the @ref lua::Valref::getUpvalues "getUpvalues" method that requires NRVO too.
*
* @section configuring_discardability Discardability
* Operation that produces @ref lua::Temporary "temporary Lua value" may be skipped if the operation result is never used.
* Such operation is called "discardable". The non-discardable operations are executed no matter what happens to results.
*
* By default, only function calls are non-discardable, but it is possible to switch this mode for:
* @li indexing, with <code><b>LUAPP_NONDISCARDABLE_INDEX</b></code>;
* @li arithmetic operations @lv52, with <code><b>LUAPP_NONDISCARDABLE_ARITHMETICS</b></code>;
* @li concatenation, with <code><b>LUAPP_NONDISCARDABLE_CONCAT</b></code>;
* @li all of the above, with <code><b>LUAPP_NONDISCARDABLE_ALL</b></code>.
*
* @section configuring_performance Performance
* To achieve best performance, API-dependent part may be included in headers as a set of inline functions.
* This mode can be used when link-time code generation is not available and the performance is crucial.
*
* It is turned on with <code><b>LUAPP_HEADER_ONLY</b></code> macro and impl.cpp no longer needs to be included.
* Note that in this mode all Lua API functions will be exposed to your source.
*
* @section configuring_stack_watch Debugging: stack integrity checking
* The <code><b>LUAPP_WATCH_STACK</b></code> enables special mode of stack integrity checking at the exense of some operational overhead.
* In this mode, when the correct sequence of stack operations is broken, non-catchable exceptions will be raised,
* leading to immediate program termination.
*
* This mode is recommended for debug purposes only.
*
*
* @page performace Performance
* The library was designed to introduce as little overhead as possible. Most functions were made inline, except those
* that interact with @ref luainc.h "Lua API" directly. In order to isolate the user from Lua API its @ref luainc.h "headers" are not used in Lua API++ headers.
* Functions that interact with Lua API were put into impl.cpp and therefore are not inlined by default.
* You can change that by using link-time code generation (called LTCG in Visual Studio and LTO in GCC).
* Alternatively, the @b LUAPP_HEADER_ONLY macro will make every function inline, but unlike normal mode
* @ref luainc.h "Lua API headers" will be included by @ref luapp.hpp as well.
*
* The library relies heavily on templates and aggressive inlining, so without optimization there will be some operational overhead.
* Use best optimization settings available for your project if you need to achieve best performance.
*
* @page compatibility Compatibility
* The library supports several Lua versions listed below. By default the library selects the most recent API version known to it.
* @section compatibility_5_1 Lua 5.1
* Also compatible with <a href="http://luajit.org/">LuaJIT</a>.
* Turned on with <code><b>LUAPP_COMPATIBILITY_V51</b></code> macro.
*
* @section compatibility_5_2 Lua 5.2
* Turned on with <code><b>LUAPP_COMPATIBILITY_V52</b></code>.
*
* Differences to mode 5.1:
* @li Lua-side arithmetics is enabled for @ref basic_values "value objects";
* @li @ref lua::Valref::len "length" operation returns @ref lua::Temporary "Lua value" instead of native size_t;
* @li the @ref lua::Context::gcIsRunning "gcIsRunning" function is available;
* @li the @ref lua::Context::getVersion "getVersion" function is available;
* @li the @ref lua::Table::raw "raw accessor" uses specialized rawgetp/rawsetp functions for pointer-type indices.
*
* @section compatibility_5_3 Lua 5.3
* Turned on by default or with <code><b>LUAPP_COMPATIBILITY_V53</b></code>.
*
* Differences to mode 5.2:
* @li native integer types are promoted to Lua number/integer subtype;
* @li values have @ref lua::Valref::linked "linked" accessor to associated value (only @ref basic_values_user "userdata" can have something associated with it);
* @li additional Lua-side operations are available: @ref idiv "integer division", @ref band "bitwise AND",
* @ref bor "bitwise OR", @ref bxor "bitwise XOR", @ref bneg "bitwise NOT", @ref shl "shift bits left", @ref shr "shift bits right";
* @li indexing values with native integer types now uses specialized geti/seti functions;
* @li @ref lua::Valref::optcast "optcast" is no longer available (it was superseded by @ref lua::Valref::to "to" with argument).
*
*
* @section compatibility_nrvo NRVO compiler capability
* NRVO is a compiler feature, extension of RVO (return value optimization). RVO in short means that if a function returns anonymous value,
* it won't be copied into result but rather constructed in-place. NRVO (named RVO) means that same thing can be done with named variable.
* This feature, if supported by compiler, allows to return @ref basic_values_anchors "anchors" from functions by value.
* Some tests and @ref lua::Valref::getUpvalues "getUpvalues" function depend on it and will be disabled if
* <code><b>LUAPP_COMPATIBILITY_NO_NRVO</b></code> macro is used.
